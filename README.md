# ENF-GR
Reference Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals from the Greek power grid are recorded 24/7 at two distinct location in Greece, namely Patras (at the Digital Signal and Image Processing Lab, ECE Dept, University of Patras, as of July 13, 2016) Lamia (at the University of Thessaly as of December 1, 2016). Every day 24 recordings (wav files), i.e. one wav file per hour, are produced and zipped in one file of approx. 150 MB. In the end of the day, the zip file is uploaded to the ftp server and is ready for delivery. Reference (ground-truth) ENF signals are extracted from power recordings, measured by a signal recorder that is connected to a power outlet using a step-down transformer. Î¤he signal is routed to the sound card and is recorded using appropriate software. A sampling rate of 1 kHz is used.
